1.Please describe in a few sentences the MVC architecture.
mvc
Model-View-Controller

It is a design pattern for software projects. The advantage of this is it helps in focusing on a specific part of the application
divided into three interconnected parts: 
Model - Model represents the structure of data, the format and the constraints with which it is stored.
View - View is what is presented to the user. Views utilize the Model and present data in a form in which the user wants.
Controller:Controller controls the requests of the user and then generates appropriate response which is fed to the viewer.


3.Explain the difference (in Javascript) between "==" & "===" logical operators.
x==y => Check if x is equal to y and does not consider the type
'22' == 22 -> true
'' == '0' -> false
0=='' -> true

x===y check the same like == but now the type is important too. (both must be of the same type)
'22'===22 -> false 
'' === '0' -> false
0===false -> false
0===0 -> true
false===false ->true
